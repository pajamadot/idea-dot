Create a synthwave track for the side-scrolling platformer video, featuring pulsating bass, shimmering synth leads, and steady drums at 120 BPM; dark minor key, tense and mysterious mood matching the rain-soaked neon cityscape; sync laser SFX with robotic guards, rhythmic drone hum; deep hall reverb, wide stereo field, and focused foreground; master for punchy dynamics with tape-saturated warmth.
