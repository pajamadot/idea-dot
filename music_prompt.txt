Compose a soundtrack that complements the balletic grace of an anime girl dancing on a sunset beach. The music, an emotional and beautiful mix of 'orchestral anime theme with piano', utilizes instruments like a gentle piano melody intertwined with soft strings, and includes a moderate tempo with emotional swells that match the dance movements. This composition should evoke a deep romantic longing, crafted with a crystal clear production that incorporates subtle reverb, creating a spacious mix that perfectly balances the soundtrack to resonate with the spirit of the ballet.
